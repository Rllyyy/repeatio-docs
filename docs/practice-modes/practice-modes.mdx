# Practice Modes

You can practice your questions in chronological (default) or random order.
There is also the option to just train with bookmarked questions.

## Chronological

The questions are in order that they were created in.

## Random

The order of the questions is random but each question will only be shown once.

## Bookmarked

To practice with the questions you bookmarked navigate to the module and click the Start > button inside Bookmarked Questions.
The questions can be practiced in chronological or random order.
